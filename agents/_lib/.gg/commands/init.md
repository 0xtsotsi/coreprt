description: Generate or update CLAUDE.md for this project
---

Generate or update the project context file with project-specific context only: what this project is, the non-obvious knowledge needed to change it safely, and the workflows that are unique to it.

This file is injected verbatim into the **cached prefix of every request in every future session**, alongside the system prompt. Every line costs tokens forever. A line that repeats something the agent already has is worse than absent: it dilutes the lines that matter. So the bar is not "is this true?" — it is **"would a competent agent get this wrong without being told?"**

## What is already in the agent's context — never restate any of it

Read this list once and apply it to every step below. These are already supplied by the system prompt, so writing them into the context file is pure duplication:

1. **Agent behavior** — Do NOT add generic agent behavior already covered by the system prompt: read before edit/write, re-read after formatters, ask before destructive actions, no fake verification, generic code-quality advice, how to use tools, or how to talk to the user.
2. **Language conventions** — a Language Style Packs section is auto-injected for every language detected in this repo. Do not duplicate language style packs, generic verification rules, or boilerplate quality gates such as "After editing ANY file" / "Code Quality — Zero Tolerance".
3. **Verify commands** — a Verification section is auto-generated from package scripts / manifests (lint, typecheck, format, test) with the correct runner already resolved from the lockfile. Only write a command down if it is NOT discoverable that way: an undocumented multi-step sequence, a required ordering, a non-obvious flag, or a command that lives outside the manifest. Never add guidance that requires running checks, builds, or the full quality suite after every edit or every file change, and never turn discovered commands into mandatory after-every-edit requirements unless local CI explicitly enforces that sequence.
4. **The file tree** — the agent can list and grep the repo in one call. Do NOT embed generated symbol maps, exhaustive file indexes, auto-generated directory listings, or large trees. Do not add symbol indexes or auto-generated project inventories; the context file must remain durable, agent-focused project context.

Include only project-specific overrides, stricter local requirements, or knowledge that cannot be derived by reading the code.

## Step 1: Pick the target filename

Context files are loaded **one per directory, first match wins**, in this priority order: \`AGENTS.override.md\` > \`AGENTS.md\` > \`CLAUDE.md\` > \`.cursorrules\` > \`CONVENTIONS.md\`.

List the repo root and write to **whichever of those already exists with the highest priority**. If the repo already has an \`AGENTS.md\`, update that file — creating a new CLAUDE.md next to it produces a file the agent will never load. If none exists, create \`CLAUDE.md\`. State which file you chose and why in one line.

## Step 2: Set up the regenerated block

\`/init\` is re-run over the project's lifetime, so the generated content must be **replaceable, not appendable** — otherwise each run grows the file forever.

All content you generate goes inside these exact fence markers:

\`\`\`
<!-- gg:init:start -->
…generated content…
<!-- gg:init:end -->
\`\`\`

- If the file exists and already has the fence: **replace everything between the markers wholesale**. Text outside the fence is user-owned — do not touch it, do not reformat it, do not move it.
- If the file exists without the fence: read it, decide which content is hand-written knowledge worth keeping, move that above the fence untouched, and put your generated content inside a new fence. Remove generic guidance that is already covered by the system prompt (see the list above) unless it is a deliberate project-specific override.
- If the file does not exist: create it with the fence.

## Step 3: Analyze the project (sub-agents in parallel)

Derive every fact from the actual project — source code, entry points, manifests, config, and history. Treat README, docs, and code comments as unverified hints that are frequently stale: never copy claims from them, and only state things you can confirm from the code and config themselves.

Spawn 3 sub-agents ${spawnParallel(3)}:

1. **Purpose & Shape Agent**: What does this project actually do, and what are its top-level parts? Read entry points, main modules, exported/public APIs, CLI commands, routes, and manifests. Return: a one-sentence purpose, and for each package/app/module a one-line statement of what it *owns*. Do not rely on the README's description. Do not return a directory listing.
2. **Gotchas & Invariants Agent**: Find the knowledge that is expensive to rediscover. Mine \`git log\` (especially revert/fix/hotfix commits), CI and release workflows, \`NOTE\`/\`HACK\`/\`IMPORTANT\`/\`WARNING\`/\`XXX\` comments, test names asserting surprising behavior, generated-file and build-order constraints, and any config with a non-default value. Return only: rules that are non-obvious from reading the code, ordering/sequencing constraints, things that silently break, and the *reason* each exists. Skip anything a careful reader would infer in 30 seconds.
3. **Workflow & Stack Agent**: How is this project run, built, released, and deployed, from authoritative sources only — package scripts, manifests, Makefiles, CI config, deploy config. Return the workflows and any command that is NOT a plain single manifest script (multi-step sequences, required order, env vars, non-obvious flags, commands living outside the manifest). Do not return commands the auto-generated Verification section already covers (see item 3 above). Do not invent commands from convention, and do not trust README/doc command snippets unless a script or manifest confirms they still exist.

Wait for all sub-agents to complete, then synthesize.

## Step 4: Write the generated block

Inside the fence, write only sections that add project-specific value. Prefer this order — drop any section that would be empty or obvious:

- Project name and one-sentence purpose
- Key packages/apps/modules and what each owns (one line each, no tree)
- Architecture or data-flow notes an agent could not infer quickly from the code
- **Gotchas / invariants** — the highest-value section. Each entry states the rule *and* why it exists.
- Project-specific commands and workflows that survived the Step 3 filter (required publish order, generated-file workflow, dev-server startup, deployment caveats, auth/secrets storage)

Avoid generic sections named "Code Quality", "Organization Rules", or "How to Work" unless every bullet is specific to this project.

## Step 5: Budget and verify

The combined budget for all project context files is 32KB, shared with any parent-directory context files. **Target 6KB or less for the generated block** — a tight 4KB file that gets read every time beats a 25KB file the agent skims.

After writing:

1. Run \`wc -c\` on the file and report the byte size. If the generated block exceeds ~6KB, cut the weakest sections (the ones closest to "derivable by reading the code") and rewrite.
2. Re-read the file and confirm every remaining line passes the bar: **project-specific, supported by a local file you actually read, and not already in the agent's context per the list above.**
3. Report in one line: which file, how many bytes, and how many lines you removed as redundant.

## Step 6: Restart Notice

End your reply with this exact notice so the user doesn't miss it:

${CLAUDE_MD_RESTART_NOTICE}
